# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
*I'm incredibly proud to have pushed through the methods lesson, practices, and assignments. I needed to advocate to other professionals and student-colleagues to talk through some of my mental blocks. I'm slowly but surely beginning to feel a little more ownership and autonomy with the syntax I'm writing.*
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
*Methods allow us to use pre-determined or independently created instructions in our programming. This boosts our efficiency and allows us to focus on the greater picture without having to write and re-write action specific code over and over.*
